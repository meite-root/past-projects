## 1. Zambia REMP

**Description:**  
This project focuses on analyzing the rollout of the Zambian Rural Electrification Master Plan (REMP) and its implications for local communities.

### Data Cleaning Process

A key step involved determining the precise locations of 7,130 schools across Zambia by matching each school to its corresponding Ward and District. For a detailed overview of the approach and results, see the interactive HTML output here:
