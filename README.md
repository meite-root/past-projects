# Past R and Stata Projects

Welcome to my curated archive of past R and Stata projects. This repository houses various real-world data analysis, cleaning, and modeling exercises.

## 1. Skilled Workers’ Mobility

**Title:**  
“Skilled Workers’ Mobility and Attrition: The Case of Florida Emergency Medicine Physicians” (August 2023)

**Description:**  
Implemented a Cox Proportional-Hazards model and fixed-effects logistic regressions to investigate relocation patterns of Florida EM physicians between 2006 and 2020, capturing their demand (preferences) for work amenities.

## 2. Armed Conflict

**Title:**  
“Colonial Legacies and Contemporary Armed Conflict in Africa” (May 2020)

**Description:**  
Implemented a negative binomial model with multi-way clustered standard errors, leveraging geospatial conflict data and demographic, geographic, and ecological datasets to assess colonial legacies’ impact on contemporary African conflicts (ArcGIS, Stata).

## 3. Zambia REMP (research assistantship)

**Description:**  
This project focuses on analyzing the rollout of the Zambian Rural Electrification Master Plan (REMP) and its implications for local communities.

### Data Cleaning Process

A key step involved determining the precise locations of 7,130 schools across Zambia by matching each school to its corresponding Ward and District. For a detailed overview of the approach and results, see the interactive HTML output here:

## 4. High Frequency Checks – Sample (research assistantship)

**Description:**  
Developed a Stata script for high-frequency data checks to support 200 field interviewers in Nigeria (NYSC project), ensuring consistent survey responses.

---

## 5. Soil – Geospatial Control Variables – Sample (research assistantship)

**Description:**  
Produced R scripts to generate geo-spatial control variables for the project “The Curse of Good Soil? Land Fertility, Roads, and Rural Poverty in Africa,” using various spatial analysis packages (terra, raster, sf) and raster data (night-lights, population, land cover).
